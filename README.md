# Text-to-Morse-code
<h2>How I approached the project</h2>.
<ul>
  <li>First visited the Wikipedia page to get the relevant information (how morse code works)</li>
  <li>Found out that the required conversion is quite simple</li>
  <li>In PyCharm, made a dictionary with every letter of the English alphabet as keys, and their morse variations as their respective values</li>
  <li>In change_morse, started with an empty string. Change the provided input string, one letter at a time. Finally, return the converted word</li>
  <li>A single unit test (using Pytest) to verify the desired functionality</li>
</ul>
<h2>What was easy? What was hard?</h2>
<p>Completing this project was really not that difficult. Just one dictionary and and function.</p>
<h2>Any improvement</h2>
<p>I would try to add more functionality to each project, using new tools.</p>
<h2>Biggest learning from today</h2>
<p>Unrelated, but I used the Terminal to execute the commands. Never did that before.</p>
<h2>Tackle the project differently?</h2>
<p>I will probably add some ASCIIÂ art at the start to make the user interface slightly better.</p>
